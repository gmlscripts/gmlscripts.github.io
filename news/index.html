<h1>Script News &amp; Announcements</h1>
<h2><span class="blogdate">February 2, 2025</span><span><a href="/news/20250202.html">GMLscripts.com 3.8 Transition (part 3)</a></span></h2>
<p><img class="fright" src="/news/images/blogicon-20250202.png" alt="/news/images/blogicon-20250202.png" title="/news/images/blogicon-20250202.png" />
This update marks the addition of a new client-side search engine. The
<a href="/search">search</a> page is accessible from the site's global navigation, currently at
the top of every page. Simply type your query and see the search results
instantly. The search corpus is composed of script pages. Search results may
be improved with the addition of tags. Implicit tags are already being used
but it is possible tags will be explicitly added to script pages to improve
results.</p>
<p>Returning to the site is the reporting of recent script changes. A list of
script changes is included on the <a href="/">landing</a> page and decorators are now added
to script definitions wherever they appear on the site.</p>
<p>Improvements have been made to news navigation but more work is required. The
two major changes needed are the pagination of the <a href="/news">news</a> index and the creation
of news summaries. These will require some thought.</p>
<p>Minor visual changes and optimizations have been made that are probably not
noticeable. Further optimizations are anticipated and a full visual overhaul
is on the horizon.</p>

<h2><span class="blogdate">January 14, 2025</span><span><a href="/news/20250114.html">GMLscripts.com 3.7 Transition (part 2)</a></span></h2>
<p><img class="fright" src="/news/images/blogicon-20250114.png" alt="/news/images/blogicon-20250114.png" title="/news/images/blogicon-20250114.png" />
Work behind the scenes continues. The site is now statically generated by
an entirely new fully offline system I've written in Python. This is my
first major Python project which has been quite a learning experience. Much
of the code is based on the old PHP dynamic page generator, but now the
site is generated in only five seconds compared to the 15 minutes it took
using <code>wget</code> to crawl a locally hosted dynamic version.</p>
<p>The new build process includes a templating engine that takes many cues
from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to empower a simple news blog, which was a fun programming
task. More work is needed to fully realize my needs. All material is now
referenced from the same single sources, so all pages and repo files should
stay in sync automatically. With any luck, there shouldn't be much visible
difference from the previous version.</p>
<p>More obvious changes have been made to the script submission process. This
includes a new <a href="/script/CONTRIBUTING">contribution guide</a> and updated <a href="/script/STYLEGUIDE">style guide</a>.</p>
<p>The next update should include a search engine, improved news navigation,
and a return of the recent changes list and script decorators.</p>

<h2><span class="blogdate">December 21, 2024</span><span><a href="/news/20241221.html">GMLscripts.com 3.6 Transition</a></span></h2>
<p><img class="fright" src="/news/images/blogicon-20241221.png" alt="/news/images/blogicon-20241221.png" title="/news/images/blogicon-20241221.png" />
This update represents one of the biggest changes to <a href="">GMLscripts.com</a> to
date and it has been a long time coming. I wasn't sure how to introduce the
changes but fate took an unfortunate turn. Some personal upheaval resulted
in the site going offline for a couple of months which somewhat forced my
hand. The site is back and at first glance, things appear the same.
However, there are two major changes.</p>
<p>First, the forums are no longer accessible. I'd been wanting to wind them
down for a few years because they were never very active and the forum
software itself is no longer maintained by its developers. Even when it was
being supported, keeping the software up to date required a lot of manual,
error-prone effort because of all the modifications I've made over the
years. However, I think GitHub can help us out, and I intend to open
<a href="https://github.com/gmlscripts/scripts/discussions">Discussions</a> there soon and script submissions can still be made via
<a href="https://github.com/gmlscripts/scripts/pulls">Pull Request</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the site is no longer dynamic. This has less of an effect on you
than on me. Until now, all script pages were generated from a pair of
source files which are found in the <a href="https://github.com/gmlscripts/scripts">GitHub Script Repository</a> — the GML
script itself and an extended Markdown document. This was a nice system
because script updates in the repo automatically appeared on the site.
However, that is over. No more PHP, no more MySQL — at least here. The
emergency "static mirror" is now the only version of the site. I still
locally generate the static version of the site using the same dynamic
backend but I'm looking into new site generation options.</p>
<p>At the moment things are in transition and less than ideal. I have more
tidying to do and I want to develop a fresh trajectory soon.</p>
<p><em>Good luck to you all in 2025.</em></p>

<h2><span class="blogdate">November 1, 2018</span><span><a href="/news/20181101.html">Massive Update - GMLscripts.com 3.5</a></span></h2>
<p><img class="fright" src="/news/images/blogicon-20181101.png" alt="/news/images/blogicon-20181101.png" title="/news/images/blogicon-20181101.png" />
I've just uploaded a massive update to the inner workings of the site.
With any luck, you will not notice any major changes (ie. broken stuff).
Hopefully the site is easier to read, a little nicer looking, and it
should load a bit quicker.</p>
<p>The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been completely overhauled and
streamlined. Heavy dependencies have been eliminated and minor ones have
been consolidated. Server software has been updated across the board.</p>
<p>In all, since the last update, Git tells me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>134 files changed, 5364 insertions(+), 1761 deletions(-)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been a big job and it is good to be finishing it. It also means
that a new big job is ahead of me: updating all scripts on the site to
<a href="/STYLEGUIDE">GameMaker Studio 2 standards</a>.</p>
<p><em>Onward and upward!</em></p>
