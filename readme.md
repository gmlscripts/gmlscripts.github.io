GMLscripts.com Static Mirror
============================

This is a static mirror of GMLscripts.com. The main site is dynamic.
This mirror was made using wget on a local copy of the site followed
by some gentle massaging to remove bits that can't work as a static
page, such as forums, releases.html, etc.

This mirror is reasonably up-to-date at any given time. Its purpose
is to take the place of the main site in case of a hosting emergency.
When such an emergency arises, this mirror will be made as current as
possible.
