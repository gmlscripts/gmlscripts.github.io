<div class="blog"><h2><span class="blogdate">January 1, 2015</span><span><a href="http://beta.gmlscripts.local/forums/viewtopic.php?id=1988&amp;action=new" title="GMLscripts.com 3.0">GMLscripts.com 3.0</a></span></h2><p><span class="postimg" style="float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em"><img src="images/blogicon-20150101.gif" alt="blogicon-20150101.gif" /></span>Happy New Year!</p><p>It&#039;s a new year and that means I&#039;m currently rolling out the new iteration of GMLscripts.com. This has been a long time coming, and I&#039;ve broken many promises along the way, but it&#039;s finally here.</p><p>There are a number of changes to talk about.</p><p>Obviously, the skin has changed. When I say this is a long time coming, I&#039;m not kidding. This visual design was created over two years ago. I was never very satisfied with it but it is functional. You may need to clear your browser cache or refresh with Shift-F5 in order to see things properly. This look may not be entirely new to you if you&#039;ve ever seen the static version of the site. That&#039;s the site I&#039;ve redirected to a few times when I&#039;ve had hosting issues.</p><p>More important than the look is the content. All of the scripts have been updated for GameMaker: Studio. The old scripts are no longer accessible. An informal Twitter poll of GMLscripts.com users agreed universally there was little point in supporting old versions of GameMaker. That certainly makes things a lot simpler to maintain. However, it&#039;s not all rainbows. There are a few scripts which still need to be tested and fixed. There are some that are completely absent. There are some which have been deprecated. I&#039;ll be ironing out these wrinkles over the next several days.</p><p>The back-end of the site has been completely overhauled. This is the main reason the update has taken so long. I tried a lot of complicated approaches that I didn&#039;t really like. I spent a lot of time and energy on systems that were inferior and redundant. In the end, the new system is similar to the old system but is simpler, more streamlined, more standardized, and more richly featured.</p><p>The forum has also received an update which will require a good deal of manual tweaking. The many modifications to the forum have not carried over to the new version. Posts that used these features will be fixed.</p><p>As this is a beta release, bugs and other problems are expected and will be dealt with as they are discovered.</p><p style="text-align:right; font-size:10px; clear:both;"><em>Posted by xot at 11:42 PM</em> - <a href="http://beta.gmlscripts.local/forums/viewtopic.php?id=1988&amp;action=new">Comments: 0</a></p></div><hr /><div class="blog"><h2><span class="blogdate">March 19, 2014</span><span><a href="http://beta.gmlscripts.local/forums/viewtopic.php?id=1976&amp;action=new" title="Big News from GDC 2014">Big News from GDC 2014</a></span></h2><p><span class="postimg" style="float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em"><img src="images/blogicon-20140319.gif" alt="blogicon-20140319.gif" /></span>OK, this a pretty big one-two punch from the good folks at YoYo Games.</p><p>The huge, huge news that was announced at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" rel="nofollow">GDC</a> today is <a href="http://yoyogames.com/news/210" rel="nofollow">GameMaker: Studio on Sony PlayStation</a>. New export modules will soon be available for PS4, PS3, and PS Vita delivery. As some have already seen, a number of GM games have made their way onto Sony already. To date, according to YoYo Games head of development Mike Dailly, all of these games have been expensive ports to other frameworks. Starting in the next few weeks, getting on Sony will be a whole lot easier. To prove it, YoYo Games is demonstrating <a href="http://yoyogames.com/news/211" rel="nofollow">19 well-known games</a> running on Sony platforms at their GDC booth right now. And it won&#039;t just be easy Â— it will be free. Sony and YoYo Games are partnering to provide free export modules to any <a href="https://www.companyregistration.playstation.com/" rel="nofollow">licensed Sony developer</a>. YoYo Games CEO Sandy Duncan says Sony are &quot;big fans of GameMaker&quot; and indicates it was the proliferation of GameMaker games on their platforms that fostered this partnership. Sony are taking indie development very seriously this generation and seem to be doing everything they can to make their platforms as accessible as possible. These are exciting times to be an indie developer and GameMaker: Studio user. Who knows what the future holds for Microsoft and Nintendo platforms? When asked about these possibilities, Duncan&#039;s response was interrupted by the sighting of nearby squirrels.</p><p><iframe style="border:0;" width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttPdRjgyTk0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>In other news, <a href="http://store.yoyogames.com/downloads/gm-studio/release-notes-studio.html" rel="nofollow">GameMaker: Studio v1.3 beta</a> was released a few days ago.

This is a significant update that adds two huge new features.</p><p>The first of these is the addition of GPU shaders. One of the places GameMaker has always lagged behind is in 3D graphics support. GameMaker&#039;s primary purpose is for making 2D games but many users have found its basic 3D capabilities tantalizing enough to go to great lengths to get around some of its limitations to create games. Over time these limits have been reduced with simple improvements like better z-buffer control and render-to-texture abilities. With the addition of shaders and an improved vertex interface, there is now little that can&#039;t be done. GLSL ES shaders are available for most platforms and Windows users have the option of using more powerful GLSL and HLSL shaders.</p><p>The second major new addition is a native code compiler. As an interpreted language, GML has earned a reputation for being slow. The new compiler should put an end to that. CPU intensive games can expect significant performance improvements. YoYo has even gone so far as suggesting some processes running up to 100 times faster. That&#039;s probably an exceptional case, but expect at least modest improvements for all games. For now, the native code compiler is only available for Windows desktop games and requires the installation of Visual Studio or free-to-use Visual Studio Express.</p><p style="text-align:right; font-size:10px; clear:both;"><em>Posted by xot at 02:48 PM</em> - <a href="http://beta.gmlscripts.local/forums/viewtopic.php?id=1948&amp;action=new">Comments: 8</a></p></div><hr />            <p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://beta.gmlscripts.local/forums/viewforum.php?id=12">Read More News</a></p>
